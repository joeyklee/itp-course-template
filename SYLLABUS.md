## DESCRIPTION

<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: LONGER COURSE DESCRIPTION ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
-->

<!-- There are more “free” applications and services than ever before that help us to quantify and track what we do, when, how, and with whom. The quantified self holds the promise of improving our lives, but there is an ambivalence to how these technologies are affecting our lives. This course will examine, question, and critique the perspectives of personal data and “the quantified self” from multiple perspectives. We will explore these perspectives by working with the tools and methodologies for collecting personal data and generate visuals and other tangible output from these data. We will introduce students to guest speakers, review and critique readings, projects, and software around the quantified self, and experiment through lab-based exercises that encourage a fluency with digital and analog visualization and data tracking tools. -->

#### WORK

<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: UPDATE WORK ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
-->

In this 12 week course, students will `do x, y, and z`. Together we will learn how `x, y, and z are related etc etc`.

Students will:
1. Create `weekly projects about x, y, and z` in order to `reinforce a, b, and c.`
2. Read `articles and books` and watch relevant `videos and movies` related to the course topics and discussion.
3. Meet `guest speakers` in order to `learn about a, b, and c.`
4. Post `assignments` in order to `document their work and get feedback`
5. Make a `final project` that demonstrates `x, y, and z`


#### LEARNING OUTCOMES

<!-- EXAMPLE

- Exposure to techniques for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing personal data
- Become conversational in the discussion around the quantified self movement (who’s who, what’s what, the history, ambivalence).
- Create visualizations (or other tangible output) that represents the student’s own relationship personal data
- “Find yourself” in the data your produce -- how does it represent you? How does it not?

-->

<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: LEARNING OBJECTIVES ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓

At the end of the course, student will likely:

- `demonstrate proficiency in X`
- `have literacy in Y`
- `have the ability to do Z`

## CLASS EXPECTATIONS
***

#### Assignments
<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: Assignments expectations via Tom Igoe ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
-->

There are assignments in this course, make sure to check the class page for the corresponding week to see the requirements for the assignments and their due dates.


#### Documentation
<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: Documentation expectations via Tom Igoe ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
-->

You’ll also be expected to document your progress in the class online in a regular blog as you go. At a minimum, you’re expected to summarize any insights you have in each week’s lab assignments, and to document your production projects and technical research thoroughly. You can find guidelines for good documentation, and several examples, on the Journals & Documentation page.

<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: Replace with relevant link if necessary ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓

#### Readings And References
<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: Readings expectations via Tom Igoe ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
-->

Topic notes to be covered each week are linked on that week’s class page. Read each week’s material before class and prepare questions.

**Prepare for class in advance. Review the material to be covered that week, and come to class with questions prepared about that class’s material. If you have no questions, be prepared to show your work.**

#### Commenting on Each Other's work
<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: Commenting expectations via Tom Igoe ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
-->

Supporting your classmates through feedback on their work is an important part of the class, and an important part of your participation grade. When watching your classmates present their work in class, we’ll make some time for verbal comments, but you should take written notes on their presentations as well. Offer suggestions on what they did well and should continue doing, what they should stop doing, and what they could add to their work and/or their presentation to make it better. Give them these notes at the end of class. You’ll be getting the same notes from your classmates, so write in the same voice in which you’d like to hear feedback on your own work.

## CLASS POLICIES
***

<!--
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓ TODO: GRADING POLICY ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
-->

#### Grading

The most important thing you can do is arrive to each class on time and be prepared to actively participate, with questions, stories of setbacks or successes you encountered in the lab, and interesting material and events related to `topic X` you’ve found. Each week, you should put in adequate time to really digest and then apply the material. We’re unimpressed by last-minute cramming. Floor 4 is the best place to do your class work, as you’ll be surrounded by your peers tackling the same topics, and you’ll have access to second-years, residents, and full-time faculty. Our time together each week, and your access to the 4th floor, is what distinguishes studying at ITP from, say, just reading the internet.

GRADE CALCULATION:
Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:
* `##`% Attendance/Participation
* `##`% Assignments
* `##`% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%

#### Participation and Attendance

Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and critique on other projects in the class is a major part of your grade. Please be present and prompt. Lateness will hurt your grade. If you’re going to be late or absent, please email your instructor in advance. If you have an emergency, please let your instructor know as soon as you can. Please turn in assignments on time as well.

## NYU STATEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES
***


### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE
The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html

### STATEMENT ON ACCESSIBILITY
Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.
STATEMENT ON COUNSELING AND WELLNESS

Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999. Also, all students who may require an academic accommodation due to a qualified disability, physical or mental, please register with the Moses Center 212-998-4980. Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

### STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES
Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.
